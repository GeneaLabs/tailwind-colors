Color palette and swatches for macOS's color picker.

## Screenshots


## Installation
1. Download the following files:
   - NSColorPanelSwatches.plist
   - Tailwind.clr
2. (Optional) If you currently have swatches in your color picker tool you want to save, create a backup copy of your local `NSColorPanelSwatches.plist` file using the following terminal command:
  ```sh
  mv ~/Library/Colors/NSColorPanelSwatches.plist ~/Library/Colors/NSColorPanelSwatches.plist.bak
  ```
3. Copy the two files you downloaded to: `~/Library/Colors/`.
4. Open the color picker tool in any Mac app, and select `Color Palettes` tab and select the `Tailwind` palette. You will also want to adjust the width and height of the color picker to show all swatches (recommended width is 10 swatches).
